# Outbreak Detection for Temporal Networks

This repository contains the data, code, and further results accompanying our submission to the Complex Networks 2019 conference.

* **Data**: This folder contains the escort dataset that we use to evaluate our method. Note that this dataset has been introduced by Rocha et al. (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001109).
* **Figures**: This folder contains i) all figures shown in the manuscript and ii) all figures that we could not show due to space restrictions.

Our algorithm as well as the evaluation process is documented in the Jupyter notebook.

The main contributor of the materials provided is:
* Martin Sterchi (sterchi@ifi.uzh.ch)
